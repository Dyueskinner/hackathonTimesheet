## How It Works

### Supervisor Registration
- Supervisors must register using an email under the domain **research#@nscc.ca**.
- Once registered, supervisors gain access to manage employees in their department.

### Employee Management
- Supervisors can register new employees, linking them to their department.
- Employees will receive login credentials after being registered by a supervisor.

### Timesheet Submission
- Employees must submit timesheets for the previous two weeks worked.
- Employees will receive a notification the day payroll ends, signaling the start of the submission window.
- The submission window closes at **11:59 PM** two days after the payroll period ends.

### Timesheet Approval
- Supervisors can view submitted timesheets from employees in their department.
- Supervisors must review and sign off on timesheets to finalize them for payroll processing.

## Payroll Cycle
Payroll runs on a biweekly schedule, ending every 15 days. Notifications are automatically sent to employees to remind them to submit their timesheets within the designated period.

## Features
- Secure user registration and authentication for supervisors and employees.
- Automated notifications for submission deadlines.
- Intuitive interface for managing and submitting timesheets.
- Role-specific permissions to ensure secure access and functionality.
